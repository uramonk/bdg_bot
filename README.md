# bdg_bot

bdg_bot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he
has, etc!

### Running bdg_bot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the environment variables they rely upon have been
set.

You can start bdg_bot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

Then you can interact with bdg_bot by typing `bdg_bot help`.
